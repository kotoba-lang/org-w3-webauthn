;; `kotoba/webauthn/ceremony.kotoba` against `webauthn.core`.
;;
;; Parity covers the ceremonies that are simply correct or simply wrong:
;; the RP's own encoding of its challenge coming back unchanged, and each
;; of the three fields disagreeing on its own. Where the two part, the test
;; drives both and shows the difference.
;;
;;   * `a-missing-field-throws-in-a-function-that-says-it-never-throws` --
;;     `verify-client-data`'s docstring is "Never throws; returns
;;     {:valid? bool :errors [...]}". clientData with no `challenge` key
;;     raises NullPointerException out of `base64url-decode`.
;;
;;   * `several-strings-name-the-same-challenge` -- `base64url-decode`
;;     reads an unknown character as zero in three positions of every four
;;     and throws in the fourth, and strips `=` from anywhere rather than
;;     from the end. `"A!AA"`, `"AAAA"` and `"AA=AA="` all decode to
;;     `[0 0 0]`; `"!AAA"` throws. The guest requires the challenge to be
;;     canonical and compares strings, which refuses the spellings instead
;;     of accepting them as equal.
;;
;;   * `cross-origin-is-not-looked-at` -- §7.2 step 9. clientData with
;;     `crossOrigin true` and everything else correct is `{:valid? true}`.
;;
;;   * `a-counter-that-returns-to-zero-passes` -- §6.1.3. A counter of zero
;;     means the authenticator implements none, which is a property of the
;;     authenticator and so is knowable from the STORED value.
;;     `verify-signature-counter` reads it from the presented value, so a
;;     stored 500 followed by a presented 0 passes -- the cloned-
;;     authenticator signal the function exists to raise.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the encoder and the options builders and is
;; not required from the guest (require-graph). It did not grow a second
;; copy of these checks (ADR-2608261100).
