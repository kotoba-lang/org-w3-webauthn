;; The gate that was missing: does the COMPILED artifact decide the way the
;; interpreter does?
;;
;; `ceremony_kotoba_test.clj` drives the guest through `kotoba.kir`, which
;; is not what ships. Until this file existed, nothing here had asserted
;; that `kotoba -M compile` produces something that answers the same way --
;; the shape this workspace keeps warning about, where a check that never
;; ran looks exactly like a check that passed.
;;
;; So: compile with the public CLI, instantiate the `.wasm` on real
;; `WebAssembly` through amu's own `runtime/browser-host.mjs`, call the
;; exports -- including the ones that take a `:document`, built host-side
;; through the runtime's own `typedValues.document` -- and hold every answer
;; against the interpreter's.
;;
;; ## Skipping is not passing
;;
;; The gate needs `kotoba`, `nbb` and an amu checkout. Each is measured by
;; RUNNING it and reading the exit code, never by `which` -- a shim whose
;; target is gone passes `which` and exits 126, which this migration has
;; already been bitten by. When a tool is absent the probe exits 3, which is
;; neither 0 nor 1, and this file reports the absence rather than asserting
;; nothing.
